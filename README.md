# This Project

This project is supposed to allow people to use a website, mobile app, and desktop app as a cookbook. I especially like this project as I like cooking, but don't like flipping through cookbooks, finding old recipes, and figuring out how I did certain things (modifiying the recipe). The idea I have for this project is something where you can add, edit, and remove recipes. Also, you should be able to rate and comment on recipes.
