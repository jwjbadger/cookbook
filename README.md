# This Project

This project is supposed to allow people to use a website, mobile app, and desktop app as a cookbook. I especially like this project as I like cooking, but don't like flipping through cookbooks, finding old recipes, and figuring out how I did certain things (modifiying the recipe). The idea I have for this project is something where you can add, edit, and remove recipes. Also, you should be able to rate and comment on recipes.

## What I Am Thinking

I am thinking that this will work so that there are **no users**. How it will work, is everyone can edit recipes, and when creating recipes, the author can specify who is titled the author for that recipe. This solution works for a small scale application (i.e. in a family or for one person), but it would have to be changed for large applications. For example, one could add a changelog to the recipe, then users could decide which version to use, or upvote versions and eventually, delete versions that are too heavily downvoted.
