# This Project

This project is supposed to allow people to use a website, mobile app, and desktop app as a cookbook. I especially like this project as I like cooking, but don't like flipping through cookbooks, finding old recipes, and figuring out how I did certain things (modifiying the recipe). The idea I have for this project is something where you can add, edit, and remove recipes. Also, you should be able to rate and comment on recipes.

## What I Am Thinking

I am thinking that this will work so that there are **no users**. How it will work, is everyone can edit recipes, and when creating recipes, the author can specify who is titled the author for that recipe. This solution works for a small scale application (i.e. in a family or for one person), but it would have to be changed for large applications. For example, one could add a changelog to the recipe, then users could decide which version to use, or upvote versions and eventually, delete versions that are too heavily downvoted.

## Cookbook-React

### Running

In order to run cookbook-react, you first need to clone the repo or only cookbook-backend and cookbook-react. Then, you need to run `npm install` in cookbook-backend and cookbook-react. To run them, on the same machine, run `npm start` in cookbook-backend and `yarn start` in cookbook-react. That should be it. Addtionaly, you can run `yarn build` to get a higher quality, fast static site.

### What I Learned

From this subproject, I learned a lot. Even though I have used React before in the [pathfinding-visualizer](https://github.com/jwjbadger/pathfinding-visualizer), I have never learned it properly. I know feel like I know React much better. Additionally, I gained experience with Express and Mongoose, and feel much better about using them in order to quickly create a backend. Finally, I learned more about creating projects and managing them with **git**. I tried seperating this project differently by having all sub-projects in one repository.
